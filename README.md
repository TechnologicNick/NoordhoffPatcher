# About
I wrote this somewhere in my first year of highschool. It was still a userscript and was able to fill in answers for the subjects Dutch, French, German and mathematics. In the third year I turned it into a Chrome extension. Noordhoff Uitgevers then released their new online homework platform, Digilino. I made the extension fill in the answers for the new platform too, which added science to the list of subjects.

# Installation
1. Clone the git repository
2. Enable developer mode on [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
